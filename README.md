README.md
I am using Git at the command line to manange version control. With each round, I am going through the same steps to edit, commit, and publish.
This exercise is my first time using the command line (via Babun) to create, modify, and push changes to a repository.
DISCLAIMER (which is not an excuse): I majored in English.
This is on-the-job training at my national laboratory. Hooray!
